1) Create an angular application using CLI. 
Create the following three components named HelloComponent, WelcomeComponent and DayComponent.
 - HelloComponent should display the message : "Hello your_Name",
 - WelcomeComponent should display the message : "Welcome to tarining_name"
 - DayComponent should display the message : "Today is current_day"
Use all above components in the parent component (i.e. app.component.ts)
Note: Make sure that the above three components should belong to app.module.ts.

2) Create a copy of the above application and make following changes to it.
 - Place each component inside their separate modules i.e. 
    - Place HelloComponent inside HelloModule
    - Place WelcomeComponent inside WelcomeModule
    - Place DayComponent inside DayModule
